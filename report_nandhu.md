# Real-Time Computer Vision Inference System  
## Final Project Report (12–26 January 2026)

---

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a **real-time computer vision inference system** using OpenCV. The system focuses on achieving real-time performance by maintaining a stable Frames Per Second (FPS) rate while executing frame-by-frame model inference.

## 2. Project Objectives
- Set up OpenCV for real-time video processing
- Design a real-time inference workflow
- Plan and implement an efficient inference pipeline
- Define and validate FPS targets
- Optimize inference speed
- Demonstrate real-time performance with a live demo

### 12 January 2026 – OpenCV Installation and Setup
OpenCV was installed and configured successfully. Camera access and video capture were tested to ensure the system could handle real-time video streams. The development environment was verified for compatibility and stability.

---

### 13 January 2026 – Design Real-Time Inference Workflow
A real-time inference workflow was designed consisting of frame capture, preprocessing, inference, postprocessing, and output display. The workflow was designed to minimize latency and allow modular development.

---

### 14 January 2026 – Inference Pipeline Planning
A detailed inference pipeline was planned. Each stage was analyzed to identify potential performance bottlenecks. The pipeline ensures consistent preprocessing between training and inference.

---

### 15 January 2026 – FPS Targets and Metrics Definition
Performance metrics were defined. The target was to achieve an end-to-end FPS of at least 25. Additional metrics included capture latency, inference time, and system stability.
